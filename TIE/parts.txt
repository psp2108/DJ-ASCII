1. Weight (just confirm once should we calculate weight on each wheel or what?)
2. Temperature or/and Thermal image (in reality some part of engine gets hotter so i guess thermal image would be a best option bcoz finding average temperature wont be a good option atleast i feel like this)
3. Pollution a vehicle is making (data will be direct under leagal range or not processed on microcontroller itself)???
4. Real image of car as it is approaching towards the barrier
5. Checking if the sliencer is producing a sound which is under a approved sound level
